# Matt's Super Cool Moxifier Script
This script can be used to transform Dragonshield MTG Scanner's export files into files that can be uploaded to Moxfield.


## How to use the script:
1. Place this script in a folder with the export files from Dragonshield and run it.
2. The script will prompt you to enter the name of the file(s) you want to tranform as well as decide if they should be transformed into decks or collections, just follow the instructions as they pop up.
3. After the script runs, "moxified" versions of your files will have been added to the folder that the script is in. Note that the script will overwrite any files with the same names as the one being created; for example, a file called "myCoolDeck.csv" might be transformed into a file called "moxifiedDeck-myCoolDeck.txt" that overwrite a file called "moxifiedDeck-myCoolDeck.txt" if one already exists.
